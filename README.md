# EC2 Auto Scaling Groups with Spot-Instances
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling allows creation of collections of instances known as Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups (ASGs) and will maintain, scale up, or scale down the number of instances needed based on scaling policies that are defined based on the demands of that particular application. <br>
Amazon EC2 Spot Instances are spare capacity available at steep discounts compared to the EC2 On-Demand price, typically between 70% and 90% off. EC2 Spot Instances can be interrupted with a two-minute notification whenever spare capacity is no longer available. It is important that applications using EC2 Spot Instances be stateless, fault-tolerant, and loosely coupled. Instances should be ephemeral so they can be easily removed and replaced as needed. <br>
